Create queries in SQL and Spark:

a) total numbers of Alerts and Customers
SQL:
SELECT
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Alert) AS alerts,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Customer) AS customers
Spark:
spark.sql("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Alert) AS alerts, (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Customer) AS customers").show();

b) total numbers of alerts grouped by watchlists

SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*), WatchlistId FROM Alert GROUP BY WatchlistId
Spark:
spark.sql("SELECT COUNT(*), WatchlistId FROM Alert GROUP BY WatchlistId").show();

c) total number of customers grouped by country column

SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*), Country FROM Customer GROUP BY Country
Spark:
spark.sql("SELECT COUNT(*), Country FROM Customer GROUP BY Country").show();

d) the most common names that trigger the alerts

SQL:
SELECT FirstName, COUNT(FirstName), Id FROM Customer C
INNER JOIN Alert A
ON A.CustomerId = C.Id
GROUP BY FirstName
ORDER BY COUNT(FirstName)
Spark:
spark.sql("SELECT FirstName, COUNT(FirstName), Id FROM Customer C
           INNER JOIN Alert A
           ON A.CustomerId = C.Id
           GROUP BY FirstName
           ORDER BY COUNT(FirstName)").show();
