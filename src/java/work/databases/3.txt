a.    What unix text processing tools do you know and which are you acquainted with?

I know of existence of at least four UNIX text processing tools: gedit, VIM, GNU Emacs and Sublime Text. I have most experience with Sublime Text, thanks to its robustness
and wide offer of available plugins (among the others for language-specific syntax colouring or even compiling and running programs within Sublime Text - without the need
of the default command line or terminal. I used to take advantage of GNU Emacs until I found out that Sublime Text is available also on Linux. VIM is also a rich text
processing tool, but the learning curve is much slower than in case of the aforementioned tools.

b. Assuming tasks/queries above - what is the best application of unix text processing tools?

An UNIX text processing tool (for example Sublime Text, but also any other tool mentioned above) would be good for creating SQL queries due to an intuitive syntax colouring.
In fact, Sublime Text's plugin called SQLTools would make it easier to create, autocomplete and execute the SQL queries and even keep the queries history for future reference.
It also has a multitude of plugins that would make a data scientist's life easier - like built-in interpreters for R, Python, Scala, Spark, Hive, Impala and many more
appliances.

c. Which of the queries you can run easily using these unix tools? Please type them here.
Supposedly, all the queries from the previous task could be run easily using Sublime Text SQLTools plugin.
